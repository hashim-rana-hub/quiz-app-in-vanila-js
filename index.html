<!-- Incorrect file path: Make sure that you have specified the correct file path to your JavaScript file in the src attribute of the script tag. Double check the spelling of the file name and directory path to ensure that it is accurate.

Server issues: If you are running your website on a server, make sure that the server is running and that it is able to access your JavaScript file. If the server is down or experiencing issues, this could prevent the file from loading.

File permissions: Check the file permissions of your JavaScript file to make sure that it is accessible by the browser. Make sure that the file has read permissions set.

Syntax errors: If there are syntax errors in your JavaScript file, the browser will not be able to execute the code. Check the console in your browser's developer tools for any error messages that may help identify the issue.

If none of these solutions work, try moving your script tag to the bottom of the <body> section of your HTML file, just before the closing </body> tag. This is generally a best practice and can help ensure that your JavaScript file is able to load correctly. -->
